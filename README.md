# General Camera Calibration

OpenCV method for calibrating cameras with python. This repo follows the
[tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html). Also here is a [Video explaining camera calibration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h7wgR5fYik) that also explains it very good 

# Cameras Calibrated

| Name | Model | Calibrated | 
| ---- | ----- | --- | 
| Web Cam Lab | web_cam | no | 

# Instructions

To correctly calibrate the camera, you can follow the instructions bellow: 

## Overview

1. Install the dependencies
2. Fill the configuration in `configuration.py`
3. Get not calibrated image using: `getImages.py`
4. Calibrate the camera using `calibration.py`

## Setup

Install the following: 

- python
- opencv

The fill in the **environment variables** in the `.env` file (you can use the `.env.example` as reference):

| Variable             | Type | Description          | Example            |
| --------             | ---- | -----------          | -------            |
| CHESSBOARD_SIZE_EVEN | int  | Chessboard side even | 16                 |
| CHESSBOARD_SIZE_ODD  | int  | Chessboard side odd  | 19                 |
| FRAME_SIZE_HEIGHT    | int  | Frame size in pixels | 1000               |
| FRAME_SIZE_WIDTH     | int  | Frame size in pixels | 1000               |
| IMAGE_EXTENSIONS     | str  | Image extension      | png                |
| MODEL_NAME           | str  | Model of the camera  | logitech-model-100 |

To see the calibration of some of the tests made, look into [cameras-configuration](cameras-configuration.csv)

Then you need *chessboard pictures* in order to calibrate the camera. You need
a chessboard with a known *mxn* grid (where **m** is even and **n** is odd).

Then you need to take **at least 14 images** with the following requirements: 

**For taking the chessboard dimensions, count the squares in a border, and subtract 1**

- The must be taken with a **static camera** (the camera is fixed and the chessboard is the only thing that moves)
- The images must display the chessboard in different positions, rotations, and small perspective changes (skewed)
- **Opencv** must be able to find the chessboard with the function  `cv.findChessboardCorners`

Then save the images under `./uncalibrated-images/<model_name>`. Then, run the script `./calibrate.py`, changing the `MODEL_NAME` variable to match the `<model_name>`

**You can use the utility script:** `getImages.py` **to get the images in the right place**

Then , use the `calibration.py` script to calibrate them.
